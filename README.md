# SpaceInvaders (Under development)
### This is an emulator for the space invaders arcade cabinet, written in C++23. 
To build it, you will need CMake Version 3.20 or higher.

Currently the Intel 8080 CPU is complete and passes all diagnostic tests I have thrown at it. You may try this by running the Intel8080TestROMs executable generated by CMake. 

Automated testing uses the Catch2 library, but this is handled with CMake. Currently no package manager is required, though, for rendering, I imagine vcpkg will be a requirement in the future of this project.

Enjoy!
